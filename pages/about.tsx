      My background is in Physics, I've studied it in{' '}
      <a href="//www.ugr.es">Granada</a> (Spain) and in{' '}
      <a href="//www.lmu.de">Munich</a> (Germany).{' '}
      I like to solve problems, the simpler the better.{' '}
      I'm from a <a href="//goo.gl/maps/pNam2Bxtsyw">tiny town in Ja√©n</a> (Spain).{' '}
      I like talking with people. I have had 3 bands in Granada for which{' '}
      I made some songs and sing. The first contact I had with web development{' '}
      was around winter 2012. Started with <a href="//nodejs.org">node</a> which led to{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/strongloop/express">express</a>,{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/jadejs/jade">jade</a> and{' '}
      <a href="//mongodb.org/">mongodb</a>, moved to{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/meteor/meteor">meteor</a>{' '}
      after which I wanted to really learn something from the ground up so{' '}
      I looked around and found <a href="//facebook.github.io/react">React</a>,
      <a href="//github.com/faye/faye">faye</a> and{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/gulpjs/gulp">gulp</a>.{' '}
      I prefer doing things and then talking about them instead of the other{' '}
      way around. I like kindness and honesty. I believe in patience and hard work.
